Salesforce Data Importer

This project is a Python-based tool designed to automate the process of importing and synchronizing data from CSV databases into Salesforce. It reads pre-prepared CSV files for Accounts, Contacts, and Opportunities, and then uses the Salesforce API to create corresponding records in Salesforce. The project is modularized for clarity and maintainability.

Overview

The Salesforce Data Importer handles three main tasks:
	1.	Creating Accounts from an accounts CSV file.
	2.	Creating Contacts by merging contact information with account IDs.
	3.	Creating Opportunities by processing opportunity data and linking it with the corresponding accounts.

The script is designed to work with the Simple Salesforce library to connect to Salesforce and create the records.

Features
	•	Account Creation: Reads account details from a CSV file, processes address and phone information, and creates Salesforce Account records.
	•	Contact Integration: Merges contact CSV data with created account data and creates Salesforce Contact records.
	•	Opportunity Processing: Maps opportunity stages, processes close dates, and creates Salesforce Opportunity records.
	•	Modular Code Design: Organized across multiple modules (accounts.py, contacts.py, and opportunities.py) for easier maintenance and scalability.
	•	CSV Output: Generates new CSV files (accounts_with_ids.csv, contacts_with_ids.csv, and opportunities_with_ids.csv) that include the Salesforce record IDs.

Prerequisites
	•	Python 3.6+
	•	Pandas: For data manipulation.
	•	Python-dotenv: For environment variable management.
	•	Simple Salesforce: For interacting with Salesforce.
	•	A Salesforce account and appropriate API credentials.

Installation
	1.	Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/salesforce-data-importer.git
cd salesforce-data-importer


	2.	Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`


	3.	Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

Configuration

The project uses environment variables for sensitive credentials. Create a .env file in the root directory with the following variables:

CONSUMER_KEY=your_consumer_key
CONSUMER_SECRET=your_consumer_secret
USERNAME=your_salesforce_username
PASSWORD=your_salesforce_password
SECURITY_TOKEN=your_security_token

The configuration module (config.py) loads these variables and establishes the Salesforce connection.

Usage

Once configured, you can run the project using the main script:

python main.py

The script performs the following:
	•	Reads accounts.csv to create Salesforce Account records.
	•	Processes contacts.csv to merge with account data and create Salesforce Contact records.
	•	Processes opportunities.csv to map stage names, format dates, and create Salesforce Opportunity records.

After execution, new CSV files with the generated Salesforce IDs will be saved:
	•	accounts_with_ids.csv
	•	contacts_with_ids.csv
	•	opportunities_with_ids.csv

CSV File Format

accounts.csv

A sample row should include the following headers:
	•	id
	•	telephone
	•	email
	•	billing_street
	•	billing_street_number
	•	billing_city
	•	Country
	•	zip
	•	company_name

Example:

id,telephone,email,billing_street,billing_street_number,billing_city,Country,zip,company_name
A,922-572-9785,cbubbear0@geocities.com,1st,2216,Ijuí,Brazil,98700-000,Realcube

contacts.csv

Expected headers:
	•	id
	•	first_name
	•	last_name
	•	email
	•	telephone
	•	company

Example:

id,first_name,last_name,email,telephone,company
1,Tony,Dykes,tdykes0@umn.edu,345-840-9409,C

opportunities.csv

Expected headers:
	•	id
	•	company
	•	opportunity_name
	•	opportunity_stage
	•	close_date
	•	product
	•	product_name
	•	amount
	•	quantity_in_stock
	•	manufacturer
	•	dimensions

Example:

id,company,opportunity_name,opportunity_stage,close_date,product,product_name,amount,quantity_in_stock,manufacturer,dimensions
1,E,Relic,The,demo,5/10/2024,wedliny,Ms,815.45,608,Bubbletube,large

Troubleshooting
	•	Salesforce Connection Errors:
Ensure that the .env file contains correct values and that your Salesforce user has API access.
	•	CSV File Reading Issues:
Make sure the CSV files are formatted correctly and are located in the root directory or the expected path.
	•	Record Creation Failures:
Check the console output for error messages. The project prints exceptions for debugging purposes.
